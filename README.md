## About the Dataset

The dataset consists of Spotify tracks with the following features:

### **Columns Description**
- `track_id`: Spotify ID for the track.
- `artists`: Names of artists (separated by `;` if multiple).
- `album_name`: Album in which the track appears.
- `track_name`: Name of the track.
- `popularity`: Popularity score (0-100), influenced by total and recent plays.
- `duration_ms`: Track length in milliseconds.
- `explicit`: Whether the track has explicit lyrics (`True` or `False`).
- `danceability`: Measure of how suitable a track is for dancing (0.0 to 1.0).
- `energy`: Perceived intensity and activity of a track (0.0 to 1.0).
- `key`: Musical key using Pitch Class notation.
- `loudness`: Overall loudness of the track (in dB).
- `mode`: Musical modality (1 = major, 0 = minor).
- `speechiness`: Presence of spoken words in a track (0.0 to 1.0).
- `acousticness`: Confidence that the track is acoustic (0.0 to 1.0).
- `instrumentalness`: Likelihood of no vocals in the track (0.0 to 1.0).
- `liveness`: Presence of an audience in the recording (0.0 to 1.0).
- `valence`: Musical positiveness of the track (0.0 to 1.0).
